# IMDB-Movie-Network-Analysis
Plotting a network of recommended movies from imdb.com.

I expanded on a database of 5000 movies from Kaggle.com by web-scraping to locate the "recommended" movies for each film in the list.   

For instance, if you go on to a IMDB.com and view a title such as follows: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111161/

There will be a section on "People who liked this also liked...", followed by a list a window of 12 recommended films.  My objective is to visualize how movies are related based on these recommendations.

The dataset can be downloaded here:

See the PDF file for the results.
